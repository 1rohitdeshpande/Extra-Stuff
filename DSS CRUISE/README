To run the project, open on Jupyter Notebook, then run all blocks start to end. Wait roughly 5 minutes 
for computer to finish training the data. Once done, fill in the sliders and info and run the final block
which tells you if you would survive or die. If you have any questions, please email me at
rohitdeshpande@berkeley.edu. Cheers!
